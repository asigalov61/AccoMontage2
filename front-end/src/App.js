    <Typography.Title level={4}>What are required before generation?</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Melody</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>AccoMonatage2 needs a leading melody to generate accompaniment. Please drag the melody to the box or click to upload your melody piece. Melody must be a single-track MIDI file (or multi-track with the melody piece at the first track).</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Phrases (segmentation)</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>You must also specify the phrases of the uploaded melody. Each phrase has a name and a length. Phrases with the same name are considered as similar phrases when generating textures. Currently, the length of the phrases only supports 4-bar and 8-bar. Please make sure your melody can fit in the phrase structures.</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>{'Tonic & mode & meter'}</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>You must specify a tonic, mode, and meter for the melody. For example, a melody piece in C Major key and four fourths beat has tonic=C, mode=Major, meter=4/4. Note that currently only 4/4 is supported.</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Chord style</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>The chord style control is optional. You can click on <Typography.Text code>Enable Chord Style Controlling</Typography.Text> to activate chord style control. Currently, there are 4 styles in total, AccoMonatage2 will tend to use the selected style to harmonize the melody (but not guaranteed).</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Texture style</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>The texture style control is also optional. Five levels of rhythm density and voice number are available.</Typography.Paragraph>

    <Typography.Paragraph>Please wait patiently, due to the limited server resource, the generating process might take 1-2 minutes. You can view the process on the left part.</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={4}>After generated</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Listen and download</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>You may click to download the generated MIDI file (chord or accompaniment). You can aslo listen to the audio of each phrase separately by clicking the piano roll.</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Change style and re-generate</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>The choosen chord style of each phrase is displayed. You can click on and choose a new style. Some styles may not be available. You can also change the texture style of the whole melody. Click on the button at the bottom to re-generate based on new styles.</Typography.Paragraph>

    <Typography.Title level={5}>Why the generation result is not satisfying?</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>There might be multiple reasons. Please go through the following check list to improve the output result.</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li><Typography.Text strong>Blank melody at the begining. </Typography.Text>AccoMontage2 marks the first bar of the melody as the begining of the first phrase. If your melody have a piece of blank at the begining and you are not willing to make it part of your phrase, please remove it (including anacrusis).</li>
        <li><Typography.Text strong>Melody is too sparse. </Typography.Text>AccoMontage2 generates only based on the melody. Please make sure the melody have enough notes for reference. Sparce melody might also produce dissatisfying results.</li>
        <li><Typography.Text strong>Melody not monophonic. </Typography.Text>AccoMontage2 prefers monophonic music. That is to say, the melody is expected to have at most one note playing at any moment.</li>
        <li><Typography.Text strong>Tempo too large or too small. </Typography.Text>In most cases, AccoMonatage2 will harmonize a bar with a single chord. If this is not your wish, you can modify the tempo to a suitable range (usually tempo between 70-120 will produce good results).</li>
        <li><Typography.Text strong>Wrong tonic/mode/meter. </Typography.Text>This might cause the algorithm to generate someting that is completely wrong.</li>
      </ul>
    </Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Paragraph>If you are very sure that the above problem is already solved, you can also try other chord styles and texture styles, or even phrase structures (e.g., split an 8-bar phrase into two 4-bar phrases).</Typography.Paragraph>
    <Typography.Title level={5}>Why the generation fails?</Typography.Title>
    <Typography.Paragraph>Please make sure the phrase label is correct. Currently, a limitation is the melody cannot exceed the labeled phrases. Please make sure your last note is within the provided phrases. Other bugs please contact <a href={true}>ly1387@nyu.edu</a>.</Typography.Paragraph>
